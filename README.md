# Deep Scanning

This repository contains the code used in my theoretical physics master's thesis titled "Summing matrix elements of the Lieb-Liniger model with reinforcement learning", which you can find [here](https://github.com/teunzwart/master_thesis).

To compile the C++ code, use

``` shell
clang++ -std=c++17 displacement.cpp -o displacement
```
